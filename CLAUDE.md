# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ Read this first — `.agents/` is the source of truth

Before doing any work, read these files in order. They are not optional — they define identity-gated permissions, the SDD development discipline, and the exact code patterns to use.

1. `.agents/workflows/onboard.md` — entry-point ruleset, run every new conversation
2. `.agents/context/understanding.md` — company / product / data model / tech decisions (the only authoritative source for product facts)
3. `.agents/context/code_conventions.md` — controller/model/response templates, frontend rules
4. `.agents/context/develop.md` — the SDD 6-phase loop (PLAN → REVISE → APPROVE → BACKLOG → EXECUTE → TEST), always-on
5. `.agents/workflows/{push,pr,start}.md` — invoked as `/push`, `/pr`, `/start`

### Identity gating (ask "你是谁?" at the start of a new conversation)

| User | Mode | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| **zyd / 张元东 / yuandong** | 🟢 peer | full-stack; trivial single-file fixes may skip Phase 1–3 |
| **wzh / 王梓珩 / Will** | 🟡 protected | **frontend UI/style only** — `.css/.less/.scss`, JSX className/文案/layout, AntD props. ❌ Forbidden: anything in `backend/`, `models/`, API routes, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `request/` config. Must walk all phases. |
| **lzy / 刘致远 / zhiyuan** | 🔵 experience | no code; collect feedback for zyd |

### SDD discipline (always-on after onboard)

- **One backlog item at a time.** Track in `task.md`. Mark `[/]` in-progress, `[x]` done.
- **No code before APPROVE.** Restate the plan, list affected files + their import/require deps, and wait for explicit "approved / 开始 / 可以".
- **Test before advancing.** A failed item is fixed in place, never deferred. Out-of-scope discoveries → new backlog item, not an in-line fix.
- **Done = pushed.** Each finished item → `/push` → mark `[x]` → next item. All items done → `/pr`.
- **Trivial exemption (zyd only):** single-line typo / CSS / rename / unambiguous single-file fix may skip 1–3. Phase 5–6 are never skippable.

### Branch policy

| User | Dev branch | Merge target |
|---|---|---|
| zyd | `ZYD_FEAT` | PR → `dev` |
| wzh | `WZH_UI` | PR → `dev` |
| — | `dev` → `main` | zyd-only, manually on GitHub |

Never commit on `main` or `dev`. PRs target **`dev`**, not `main`. Before pushing, rebase on `origin/dev`.

### Hard boundaries (any mode)

- ❌ No silent errors. Every catch returns a specific message; never `catch(e){}`.
- ❌ No hacks: no `setTimeout` instead of real async, no hardcoded workarounds, no `// @ts-ignore`.
- ❌ Never drop Mongo collections/indexes — founder does that manually.
- ❌ Don't touch `docker-compose.yml` ports or `.env` content (tell the user what to add instead).
- ❌ No hardcoded secrets, no `eval/exec`.
- ✅ Soft-delete via `removed: true`, never physical delete.
- ✅ All endpoints behind `adminAuth.isValidAuthToken` (already wired in `app.js`).
- ✅ Migrations must be idempotent.
- ✅ Money math via `helpers.calculate.multiply/add/sub` — never native `+ - *` (float precision).
- **Core infra awareness:** Ola CRM is Ola Technologies' own MERN codebase. Modifying core infrastructure (`createCRUDController`, `errorHandlers`, the auto-route registration in `appApi.js`) requires explicit reasoning — these drive the entire CRUD layer.

### MVP product rules (Lead-to-Quote loop)

The product is **Ola** — AI-native foreign-trade ERP/CRM. MVP closed loop:
WhatsApp inquiry → Agent extracts product needs → match `Merch` (by `serialNumber`, `description_en/cn`) → assist user creating a `Quote` (status `draft`).

- ❌ Agent **never invents prices** — leave the price field empty for the salesperson.
- ❌ Agent **never silent-errors on missing Merch** — explicitly tell the user "未找到 [产品名]，请在 Merchandise 添加".
- ✅ Use a generic `channel` field — never hardcode `whatsapp` as the only source. WeChat / Email come next.
- The "Ask Ola" page is the AI entry point. UI shell exists; AI backend is wired through `controllers/appControllers/olaController` proxying to NanoBot.

## Sibling repo: `nanobot/` (Python AI backend)

`crm/` is opened, but **the sibling `../nanobot/` folder is also part of this work** — it's the AI backbone that powers Ola's Agent. Treat `../nanobot/` as readable source you may need to consult, even though this CLAUDE.md lives in `crm/`.

- **Source:** [HKUDS/nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), version **v0.1.4.post6**, ~4k LOC core. **Do not rewrite in Node.js** — the decision is to keep it as a Python microservice.
- **Deployment model:** Nanobot runs as a separate service alongside CRM (Docker Compose). CRM's `olaController` HTTP-proxies `/api/ola/chat` to NanoBot's serve endpoint (see commit `b07adb3`).
- **Architecture inside `../nanobot/`:** `agent/` (loop, context, memory, skills, subagent, tools), `channels/` (13 channels incl. WhatsApp, WeChat, Email), `providers/` (OpenAI/Anthropic native SDKs after litellm was removed in v0.1.4), `bus/` `heartbeat/` `cron/` `skills/` `session/` `bridge/` (Node.js Baileys WhatsApp bridge).
- **Integration design:** MCP is the planned standard interface — CRM backend exposes business actions as MCP tools that NanoBot can call. When touching this seam, design tool schemas carefully (strong types, no nullable surprises).
- When working across both repos, state which side a change goes in **before** editing. A change in `../nanobot/` is not bound by Ola CRM's Node/Mongoose conventions but is bound by the same SDD discipline and "no silent errors" rule.

## Project

OlaCrm (forked from EasyCRM) — a CRM/ERP for clients, quotes, invoices, purchase orders, payments, comparisons, and reporting. Node.js 20 + Express + MongoDB backend, React 18 + Vite + Ant Design + Redux Toolkit frontend. Production target: `https://erp.olajob.cn`.

## Common commands

Backend (`cd backend`):
- `npm run dev` — nodemon on `src/server.js` (port `8888`)
- `npm start` — production start
- `npm run setup` / `npm run add-admin` / `npm run upgrade` / `npm run reset` — scripts in `src/setup/`
- Tests: jest is installed (with `mongodb-memory-server` + `supertest`) but there is no `test` script defined; run with `npx jest` (single file: `npx jest path/to/file.test.js`).

Frontend (`cd frontend`):
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server on port `3000` (proxies `/api` and `/export` → `http://localhost:8888`)
- `npm run dev:remote` — dev server proxying to `VITE_BACKEND_SERVER` instead of localhost
- `npm run build` / `npm run preview`
- `npm run lint` — ESLint, `--max-warnings 0`
- Tests: vitest is installed but no `test` script; run with `npx vitest` (single file: `npx vitest run path/to/file.test.jsx`).

Deploy:
- `docker compose up -d --build` (frontend on 3000, backend on 8888, expects backend `.env`)
- `./deploy.sh` — rsyncs to `DEPLOY_SERVER_IP:DEPLOY_REMOTE_DIR` (defaults `43.99.57.106:/app/crm`), then runs docker compose remotely and hits `GET /health`.

## Architecture

### Backend (`backend/src`)

Entry: `server.js` → `app.js`. Module aliases via `module-alias`: `@` → `src` (used as `require('@/...')`).

Routing layers, all mounted in `app.js`:
- `coreAuthRouter` — public auth (`/api`)
- `coreApiRouter` — core (settings, users), behind `adminAuth.isValidAuthToken`
- `erpApiRouter` (`routes/appRoutes/appApi.js`) — entity CRUD, also auth-gated
- `coreDownloadRouter` (`/download`), `corePublicRouter` (`/public`)
- `exportRoutes` (`/export/excel`) — **no auth**
- `GET /health`, `GET /debug/settings` — utility

**Entity routes are auto-generated.** `models/utils/index.js` globs `src/models/appModels/**/*.js` and builds `routesList`. `appApi.js` then loops `routesList` and registers a standard set per entity against `controllers/appControllers[controllerName]`:

```
/<entity>/create | read/:id | update/:id | delete/:id | search | list | listAll | filter | summary
```

Plus conditional extras:
- `mail` for `invoice`, `quote`, `payment`
- `convert/:id` for `quote`
- `copy/:id` for `invoice`, `quote`, `purchaseorder`

Adding a new entity = add a Mongoose model under `models/appModels/` **and** a matching controller folder under `controllers/appControllers/` exported via its `index.js`. Special-case routes (e.g. `comparison/*`, `priceSearch/history`, `ola/chat`) are appended manually at the bottom of `appApi.js`.

Controllers use the `catchErrors` wrapper from `handlers/errorHandlers` (which also provides `notFound` and `productionErrors`).

PDF generation goes through Gotenberg (`GOTENBERG_URL`); excel export lives in `controllers/excelController` + `routes/exportRoutes.js`. The `olaController` proxies AI chat to a NanoBot serve backend (see recent commit `b07adb3`).

### Frontend (`frontend/src`)

Entry: `main.jsx` → `RootApp.jsx`. Routing split into `router/AuthRouter.jsx` and `router/AppRouter.jsx`; route table in `router/routes.jsx`. Path alias `@` → `src` (vite + jsconfig).

State: Redux Toolkit store in `redux/store.js` with reducers under `redux/{auth,crud,adavancedCrud,erp,settings}` plus `storePersist.js` for localStorage hydration.

The UI is built around reusable **Modules** in `src/modules/` that wrap generic CRUD/ERP behavior:
- `CrudModule` / `AdvancedCrudModule` — generic list/create/update/read/delete pages driven by config + a `dataTableColumns` / form component
- `ErpPanelModule` — quote/invoice/PO/payment-style document pages (line items, totals, PDF, mail)
- Domain wrappers: `QuoteModule`, `InvoiceModule`, `POModule`, `PaymentModule`, `ComparisonModule`, `EmailModule`, `DashboardModule`, `SettingModule`, `AuthModule`, `ProfileModule`

Per-entity pages under `src/pages/` typically just compose one of those modules with an entity config + form component from `src/forms/`.

`request/request.js` is the central axios client; `redux/crud` and `redux/erp` slices dispatch through it. `request/devMockInterceptor.js` can stub endpoints during dev. Locale files in `src/locale/`, layout shell in `src/layout/` and `src/apps/` (`ErpApp.jsx`, `Header`, `Navigation`, `OlaChatPanel`, `OlaOs.jsx`).

### Key env vars

Backend: `DATABASE`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT` (8888), `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (CSV; falls back to permissive regex), `PUBLIC_SERVER_FILE`, `GOTENBERG_URL`, optional `RESEND_API`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Frontend (build-time): `VITE_BACKEND_SERVER`, `VITE_APP_API_URL`, `VITE_FILE_BASE_URL`, `VITE_DEV_REMOTE` (set to `remote` to make `dev` proxy to `VITE_BACKEND_SERVER`), `VITE_PORT`/`PORT`.
